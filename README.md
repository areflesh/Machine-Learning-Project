### Abstract 

Human activity recognition is one of the interesting spheres for machine learning. We can measure human
activity by several methods and then try suggest right decisions about conditions of health of person.
Smartphones help us to provide all necessary information for making such kind of models. This project is
about using randomForests and SVA algorithms in making decision models and comparison of this algorithms in R.
